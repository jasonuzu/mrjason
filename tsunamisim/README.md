# Tsunami Simulation Program

An interactive 3D tsunami simulator that visualizes the impact of earthquakes of different magnitudes on a beachfront city.

## Features

- Adjustable earthquake magnitude (0-9.9 on the Richter scale)
- Real-time wave height calculation using empirical formula
- 3D visualization of tsunami impact on buildings, cars, and people
- Damage cost estimation based on wave height
- Interactive controls (Play/Pause/Reset)
- X-ray view to see underwater effects
- Simulation summary with key metrics
